# This table documents principal variables defined under the function domain B.lightp
# B = binary-based coordinates, lightp = lights-out puzzle problem
#
# Valid values that are interpreted default values for optional arguments include:
#   integers, reals, FALSE, NA, strings of contiguous non-space characters other 
#   than the two special keywords 'required' and 'internal'. These two keywords are
#   interpreted internally to the program and do not represent optional arguments.
#
# Characters ';' and '"' should be excluded from variable description.
#
# All variable descriptions are limited to 80 characters per line; if description
# is on more than a single line, values of variableName and variableDefault must be 
# repeated for each continuation line.
