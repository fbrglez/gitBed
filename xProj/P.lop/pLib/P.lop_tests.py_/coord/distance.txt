>>> P.coord.distance("??")
This procedure takes two permutations such as **3 1 2 4** and **4 1 2 3**
and returns the value of permutation distance, which is defined by the 
crossing number of edges in a two layer graph formed by the permutation at 
each layer. This formulation is a special case of formulas introduced in 
the  article
