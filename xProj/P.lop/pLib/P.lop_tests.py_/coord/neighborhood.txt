Valid query is 'P.coord.neighborhood ??'
>>> P.coord.neighborhood('??')

This proc takes a permutation coordinate such as **a b c d e** (here, of size 
L = 5) and returns the complete set of adjacent coordinates (i.e. coordinates
with the permutation distance of 1 from the reference permutation. The size 
of this set of adjacent (or neighborhood coordinates) is L-1.
