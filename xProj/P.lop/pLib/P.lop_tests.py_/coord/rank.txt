Valid query is 'P.coord.rank ??'
>>> P.coord.rank('??')

This function takes a permutation coordinate as a list such as [4, 1, 2, 3] and
returns its inversion number, which can also be interpreted as the distance 
from [1, 2, 3, 4] or also as 'the rank' of the coordinate in the Hasse graph 
with respect to its coordinate in natural order, here [1, 2, 3, 4].
