template for this report is based on an eBook template 
at~\url{https://github.com/fbrglez/gitPublic/tree/master/xLatex} which itself is a derivate of the Tufte Book Template

summarizes our work on the project
with a working title of 
{\em On Rapid Prototyping of Combinatorial Solvers}.
\par
As a prerequisite, we have installed the {\em R} shell, the {\em tcl/TkCon} shell, the {\em python} shell, and various \LaTeX\ templates. The default working shell is
{\em bash} under linux for Yang Ho and {\em bash} under MacOSX for Johnny Nguyen.
The files shared in the project are accessible on  
GitHub\cite{Lib-OPUS2-gitPublic-Brglez}.

All of the initial prototypes of combinatorial solvers are written in tcl and
are introduced, with required tcl commands and test cases, during the weekly class meeting by the instructor. There are several goals of this project. First, we observe the behaviour and learn about properties of each solver in real time
by executing tcl commands and modifying the tcl code, rather than study the pseudo code in 
the abstract. Second, we learn about python to construct a solver that is comparable to
the tcl implementation, not only in consiseness and clarity but most importanly, may well exceed the runtime performance of the tcl solver. Third, we instrument each solver
for performance evaluation on a large number of instances running on the same CPU, so we can infer performance differences between solvers that are statistically significant.
\par
Our current work involves two combinatorial solvers:
one solves the {\em lightout puzzle}, one solves the {\em linear ordering problem}.
The various phases of this project are summarized into sections as outlined
under {\em Contents} 
below\footnote{Note that each line in the ``Contents'' also represents a hyperlink to the respective section and subsection.}.
