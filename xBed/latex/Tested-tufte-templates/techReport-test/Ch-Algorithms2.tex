\chapter{More About Algorithms}
\label{chap-Algorithms2}
\newthought{Algorithms in this chapter} have been created for further testing
of this template.
Currently, we expect algorithms placed into different chapters to
have a running counter that spans all chapters -- unlike Figures and Tables
that have a two part counter: {\tt byChapter.byInCapterCounter}.

\newthought{Question is:} can the template be tweaked to generate algorithm counter
in the same style as we have for Figures and Tables.

\newthought{In addition:} we also illustrate two algorithms that are embedded into the figures environment. 

\newthought{The example  of Algorithm~\ref{alg-newPivot2-normal}} is normal width on a half-page.
The example of Algorithm~\ref{alg-newPivot2-wide}   is full   width on a half-page.

\newthought{The example  of Figure~\ref{fg-lssMAts-lssRRts}} is in two columns on a half-page.
The example of Figure~\ref{fg-global-search2} is in two columns on a full-page.
The figure environment can clearly be used to reference the any algorithm within the figure environment.
