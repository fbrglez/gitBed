The public is more familiar with bad design than good design.
It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, 
because that is what it lives with. 
The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.

literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, 
because I would never have thought of them or perceived

\chapter*{About This Book}
\vspace*{-7ex}
\newthought{This book} serves (1) to test and (2) to illustrate features of the Tufte book template,
using the material from the original template and 
various inserts from our article drafts. 
This book has three chapters with two sections in each chapter.
The chapter titles are:
{\em (1): About Text Items}, 
{\em (2): About Figures}, and
{\em (3): About Tables}.
Each  chapter has two sections, 
(1) dealing with items from Tufte's book template,
(2) dealing with inserts from our article drafts.

\vspace*{-0ex}
\newthought{Template incompatibilites} with our article drafts include (so far):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Neither the {\tt subfigure} nor the {\tt subcaption} packages are compatible with this template;
this necessitates that subfigure labels such as (a), (b), etc should become an integral part of
the subfigure. In other words, if the subfigure is created in R, the label created in R should 
extend to (a), or (b), etc.
\item
The package {\tt cite} is not compatible, so 
when we list 5 citations with a single \verb+\cite+ command, 
it is not possible for these citations to appear in a contracted form such as [1]-[5].
\item
{\em NO} citations can be placed inside either figure or table captions.
However, with each of these captions, one {\em can} place hyperlinks with the \verb+\url+ command,
and one {\em can} refer to other figures and tables with the \verb+\ref+ command.
Also, {\em NO} \verb+\verb+ commands can be placed inside either figure or table captions!
\end{itemize}
Still, the workarounds to avoid these incompatibilites are rewarded the with well-designed book layout that this template enables.
