\TOPIC{About the labs problem}
The {\em aperiodic low-autocorrelation binary sequence} (\labs) problem 
has a simple formulation: take a binary sequence of length $L$,  
$S = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_L$, $s_i \in \{ +1,-1 \}$, the autocorrelation function
$C_k(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{L-k}s_{i}s_{i+k},$ and minimize the energy function:
\begin{equation}
E(S) =  \sum_{k=1}^{L-1}C_{k}^{2}(S)
\label{eq_energy}
\end{equation}
or alternatively, maximize the 
{\em merit factor F}\cite[-1ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-1977-IEEE_TIT-Golay,
Lib-OPUS-labs-1982-IEEE_TIT-Golay,
Lib-OPUS-labs-1990-IEEE_TIT-Golay-skewsym}:
\begin{equation}
F(S) =  {L^2}/({2E(S)}).
\label{eq_meritFactor}
\end{equation}
 

The asymptotic value for the maximum merit factor $F$, introduced
by Golay, has been re-derived
using arguments from statistical mechanics\cite[2ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-1987-JourPhys-Bernasconi}:
\begin{equation}
{\rm as~~~} L \rightarrow \infty {\rm ,~~~then~~~}F  \rightarrow 12.3248
\label{eq_asymptotic}
\end{equation} 
The publication of the asymptotic value in Eq. \ref{eq_asymptotic}
is providing an on-going challenge since no published solutions can yet claim to converge to this value
as the length of the sequence increases.

\TOPIC{More about the labs problem}
Finding the optimum sequence is significantly harder than solving the special cases of the Ising spin-glass problems with limited interaction and periodic boundary conditions, for 
example\cite{Lib-OPUS-labs-2003-GECCO-Goldberg-periodic}. 
While effective methods have been presented to solve the special 
cases\cite[3ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-2003-GECCO-Goldberg-periodic}, up to $L = 400$, 
the best merit factors that has also been {\em proven optimal} for the problem as formulated in Eq. \ref{eq_meritFactor}
are presently known for values of $L \le 60$ 
only\cite[3ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-1996-JPhysA-Mertens-BB_solutions}.
A web page of \labs\ best merit factors and solutions, 
up to the sequence length of $L=304$, has been compiled by Joshua Knauer in 2002.
This page is no longer accessible and has now been restored 
at two mirroring sites\cite[3ex]{Lib-OPUS2-labs-2014-homepage-Knauer} next to 
additional and  comprehensive tables of {\em best-value solutions}.
These tables contain not only updates on the best known figures of merit but also 
on the number of {\em unique}  solutions in {\em canonic form} and the solutions themselves.

{\bf Now, we need more text on this page if we are to make
extra space for the citation that should be moved into the margins on the next page.}
Can or should we have {\em some citations} not appear in the margin, only at
under Bibliography at the very end? Such a feature would not appear logical
in the context of Tufte's book template, would it?
The message from Tufte's book template seem to be: do not overcrowd with citations on any given page,
have sufficient text to justify the introduction (and context) of any new citation ... This criterion can be considered different for books when compared to peer-reviewed article ...

Relationships between results reported 
in\cite[-5ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-1982-IEEE_TIT-Golay,Lib-OPUS-labs-1985-Phillips-Beenker}
and\cite[3ex]{Lib-OPUS-labs-1987-JourPhys-Bernasconi,Lib-OPUS-labs-1990-IEEE_TIT-Golay-skewsym}, 
and all subsequent updates under\cite[3ex]{Lib-OPUS2-labs-2014-homepage}
are depicted in four panels in Figure~\ref{fg-R-labs-wide-4-figures} (See Chapter~\ref{chap-Figures}.
The latest experimental results support the trend towards the conjectured asymptotic value of $F=12.3248$,
however as we demonstrate later on in the paper, the computational cost to reach this value may well exceed the currently available resources unless a better solver is discovered.
